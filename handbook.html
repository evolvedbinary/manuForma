            <h2 id="what-manuforma-does">What manuForma does</h2>
            <p>manuForma is a tool that allows you to create TEI-XML files of manuscripts and other
                related entities inside your browser without the need of external programs like
                OxygenXML. You can submit the files to a GitHub repository or save them on your
                local hard drive. Whenever you want to continue working on your records, you can
                again load them into manuForma. It also allows you to reference different records to
                model dependencies between them, such as persons who are referenced as authors in
                work records. And you can even express complex relationships between your
                records.</p>
            <h2 id="what-this-handbook-does">What this Handbook does</h2>
            <p>This handbook will introduce you to the functionalities of <em>manuForma</em>. You
                will learn how to create records, how to load existing records, how you can edit
                them and how to create references between them. In other words, this handbook is
                concerned with the technical side of TEI records. You will not learn how to describe
                manuscripts from a paleographic point of view. We assume that you already know these
                things. manuForma provides explanations about the intended usage of the fields when
                you hover your mouse over the “?” button next to the field’s name.</p>

            <p>To enter data, select one of the subsections on the left side of the application.
                Each subsection is subdivided into collapsibles that aggregate the data into smaller
                parts. The headlines of collapsibles summarize the kinds of data that can be
                entered. Sometimes these headlines change when data have already been entered,
                summarizing the main points.</p>
            <p>The largest units you can edit in manuForma are collapsibles–units containing several
                fields and features. Together they often comprise complex items such as
                bibliographic entries.</p>
            <h3 id="create-collapsibles">Create collapsibles</h3>
            <p>To create a new collapsible, open one of the existing collapsibles in the document
                and select the first grey button starting with a plus sign and then a description of
                its contents. For example:</p>

            <h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>
            <p>Fields are the main components that you will interact with in manuForma. They are
                usually blank fields into which you enter text. Others offer dropdown menus with
                options to choose from, allowing us to maintain consistent in our terminology. And
                some fields are filled out automatically when linking records like persons, works,
                etc.</p>
            <p><strong>💡</strong> Because there can be dozens of different fields in large records
                like manuscripts, manuForma offers concise help texts. They may be found to the
                right of the field name, mouse over the question mark to activate it.</p>
            <p><strong>💡</strong> The MAJLIS team is using domain-specific vocabulary to describe
                bibliographic, codicological, paleographic and other phenomena. This allows our team
                to use manuForma more efficiently without the need to learn how they are called in
                TEI. In case you do want to know the field’s original name in TEI, mouse over the
                TEI symbol to the right of the field name.</p>
            <p>The templates for the different entity types are equipped with many fields for you to
                fill in. However, it may be necessary to create, delete, or move fields to fit the
                needs of your entry.</p>
            <h3 id="create-fields">Create Fields</h3>
            <p>To create a new field, go the field containing (it may take little while to find the

            <p>Features provide additional information to fields. You never have to enter text into
                features, as they usually offer dropdown menus with options to choose from. Other
                features are filled out automatically when linking records like persons, works,
                etc.</p>
            <h3 id="create-features">Create Features</h3>
            <p>To create a new feature, go the field containing (it may take little while to find
                the correct field) and open the dropdown list. Select the desired feature. Click
                “Add feature”.<br />

            <h2 id="add-references-to-other-records">Add References to Other Records</h2>
            <p>At the moment you can add references to the following elements: placeName, author,
                personName, and title. The process of referencing them is the same for all of
                them:<br /> 1. Go to an element that supports references or create one.<br /> 2. In
                the same row as the element name, click the option “Look up”.<br /> 3. A small
                window opens. Write the name of the record into the search bar and press the
                magnifying glass button.<br /> 4. Choose an entry from the list of results and click
                “Add to Record”. Then close the window.<br /> 5. The name of the record has been
                copied into the element and the URI has been added to the ref attribute.</p>
            <p><strong>💡</strong> If the record you want to reference does not exist yet, you can
                create one on the spot. Click the “New person name” / “New place name” / “New title
                name” button. And you will be directed to the correct form. <strong>Note that you
                    have to submit and merge the new record before you can find it in
                    manuForma.</strong></p>
            <h2 id="create-relationships-between-records">Create Relationships between Records</h2>
            <p>We use the same basic principles for creating relationships that we already know from
                the section on references–the main difference is that several records are looked
                up.</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Create a Relation element. It should contain most of the fields you need–but
                    when dealing with groups of people or items you may need to create additional
                    fields.<br />
                </li>
                <li>In the field “Description of relation” select an option from “Choose the type”.
                    If the relationship contains in its description [Subject] and [Object], proceed
                    with a). If it contains [Mutual], proceed with b). <ol type="1">
                        <li>In the relation “Abraham is the father of Yahya” the person entry of
                            Abraham is the subject and the entry of Yahya is the object of the
                            statement. The relationship is calling for the fields “Subject of
                            relation” for Abraham and “Object of relation” for Yahya. Look up the
                            identifier for both fields as described above in the section “Add
                            References to Other Records”.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>In the relation “Yefet and David corresponded with each other” both
                            persons are mutuals of the statement. The relationship is therefore
                            calling for the field “Mutual relation” for both Yefet and David. Look
                            up the identifier for both fields as described above in the section “Add
                            References to Other Records”.</li>
                    </ol></li>

            <h2 id="edit-transcriptions">Edit Transcriptions, Translations and Descriptive
                Texts</h2>
            <p><strong>manuForma does not offer a fully fledged text editor!</strong> Instead, users
                can enter markup like italic text in selected fields using a number of special
                characters, or <em>Markdown</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
            <p><strong>💡</strong> The technology behind manuForma, XForms, does not allow us to
                create rich text fields that we know from other software. For this reason we had to
                come up with this workaround. manuForma will convert the markdown characters into
                the proper TEI tags when submitting the file to GitHub, creating valid TEI. Whenever
                a record is loaded into manuForma, the TEI commands are replaced with markdown and
                you can continue to edit the texts.</p>
            <p>So far, users can add the following text markup:</p>
            <h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
            <p>To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.</p>

            <p>Reusing TEI records from other projects is a complex process that cannot only be
                performed in manuForma. The most important prerequisite is to align the legacy data
                with the TEI schema used in manuForma – otherwise fields may not be displayed and
                new additions may not be reliably saved.</p>
            <p><strong>💡</strong> If you are dealing with a large number of records you may want to
                add the project metadata of your research project to all files in Oxygen XML or
                another XML processor for convenience.</p>
            <p>In manuForma you can add the project metadata of your research project to individual
                records in the main menu:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Select the collapsible “Assign project metadata”.<br />
                </li>

                <li>Click “Load Project Metadata”.<br />
                </li>
                <li>Proceed with editing or submitting the modified record, as described in other
